          summary: "A symlink farm manager, simpler alternative to GNU Stow"
          detailed_description: |
            lnko is a symlink farm manager that helps organize dotfiles and
            configuration files. It creates symlinks from a source directory
            to a target directory, with support for tree folding, conflict
            handling, and two-phase execution.
